# PokerPad

## Synopsis
PokerPad is a hotkey software for iPoker, Sky Poker, 888 and SwC Poker. It allows linking keyboard keys (or mouse/joypad buttons) to specific actions on the Poker client. For example, a user can link F2 to the action "bet 3/4 of the pot".

The current development is focused on cash games. Your mileage may vary with SNG and Tournaments.

## Credit and Support
PokerPad was originally developed by Xander. There is no official passing of the baton, but the only known (semi-)regular maintainer is github's karimb (me). Many features initially developed by Xander were removed to keep PokerPad small and maintainable long term.
