# PokerPad

## Synopsis
PokerPad is a hotkey software for iPoker, Sky Poker, 888 and SwC Poker. It allows linking keyboard keys (or mouse/joypad buttons) to specific actions on the Poker client. For example, a user can link F2 to the action "bet 3/4 of the pot".

The current development is focused on cash games. Your mileage may vary with SNG and Tournaments.
