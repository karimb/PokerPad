0.1: Initial release

(xor - iPoker)
Version 0.1.26

- fixed basic betting functions for the new ipoker software.
Note 1:  we no longer read the screen for potsize but calculate it from the
  dealer messages. They must be set to verbose in the ipoker software.
Note 2: Tables must be at the default size, else you'll get misclicks.


Version 0.1.25

Changes relative to the last Pokerpad release (0.1.24):

- update the Absolute part to work for the Cereus network;
  enable the hotkeys for absolute and relative pot bets

- update the Ipoker part for the absolute /relative bets to work
  again, including the new Euro and GBP tables.
NOTE: the potbets only work when verbose dealer messages are on

- make the clear / focus betbox code work for Pokerstars, as I hate
  having to use the mouse to do this
